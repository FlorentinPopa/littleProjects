The begin of this story in IT world. You will find some little projects where I was trying to practice what I've learned.

- a miniproject where I was trying to copy two pages of bootstrap;
- calculator with pure HTML, CSS and JS;
- Roll The Dice - Pure CSS Flex & JS;
- Demo of a layout with CSS Grid system;

Later I will update this repo with my latest project with Angular.
